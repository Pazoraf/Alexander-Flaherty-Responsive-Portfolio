# Alexander Flaherty Responsive Portfolio


## Description
My intention with this project was to create a responsive website portfolio to demonstrate my skills for prospective employers. To do this I wanted to implement my knowledge of flexbox, media queries, CSS variables, and grid to create a webpage that is responsive to different screen sizes, and to also have a section that showcases my deployed web applications.

The site is deployed [here.](https://pazoraf.github.io/Alexander-Flaherty-Responsive-Portfolio/)
